  // Note: Using CRTP static casts in several functions of this base
  // template instead of making called functions virtual or duplicating
  // the code of calling functions in the derived partially specialized
  // template
继承自MPMCQueueBase，使用CRTP避免了虚函数的开销

  /// Enqueues a T constructed from args, blocking until space is
  /// available.  Note that this method signature allows enqueue via
  /// move, if args is a T rvalue, via copy, if args is a T lvalue, or
  /// via emplacement if args is an initializer list that can be passed
  /// to a T constructor.
blockingWrite


  /// If an item can be enqueued with no blocking, does so and returns
  /// true, otherwise returns false.  This method is similar to
  /// writeIfNotFull, but if you don't have a specific need for that
  /// method you should use this one.
  ///
  /// One of the common usages of this method is to enqueue via the
  /// move constructor, something like q.write(std::move(x)).  If write
  /// returns false because the queue is full then x has not actually been
  /// consumed, which looks strange.  To understand why it is actually okay
  /// to use x afterward, remember that std::move is just a typecast that
  /// provides an rvalue reference that enables use of a move constructor
  /// or operator.  std::move doesn't actually move anything.  It could
  /// more accurately be called std::rvalue_cast or std::move_permission.
